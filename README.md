# Dinosaur Infographic - Project #1 Udacity's Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree

# Description
This project gets user data and compare it to a selection of dinosaur facts.

The purpose of this project was to use constructor functions to make objects and to use inheritance by prototypes.

# Prerequisite
None

# Using the App
Fill the user data and click the Compare Me! button to see yourself compared to dinosaurs, and another weird "dinosaur".
You can keep on trying with the Compare Me Again! button; that will shuffle again the dinos and show different facts.
